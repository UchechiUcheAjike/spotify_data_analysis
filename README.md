Data analysis
# Overview

{I am trying to analyze data to learn about the correlation between different parts of the data. I am also trying to visualize and draw insights from this data with python libraries and functions}

{I am analyzing Spotify data set. Spotify is one of the World's most popular streaming services and they have provided some free data on the [(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)] website}

{I am analyzing this data to get real time experience analyzing real data. I want to build my experience and skill in data analysis}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}
